SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderId, ProductName, Quantity FROM OrderDetails AS od INNER JOIN Products AS p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID ORDER BY od.OrderID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT e.FirstName || " " || e.LastName AS EmployeeName, od.ProductID, od.Quantity FROM (Employees as e INNER JOIN Orders AS o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID) INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID ORDER BY EmployeeName;
